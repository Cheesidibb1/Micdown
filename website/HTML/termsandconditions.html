        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</p>
        <p>Welcome to MicDown! By accessing or using our platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using MicDown, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using our services.</p>

        <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree to use MicDown responsibly and not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engage in harassment, hate speech, or abusive behavior.</li>
            <li>Share or promote illegal, harmful, or explicit content.</li>
            <li>Impersonate others or misrepresent your identity.</li>
            <li>Use automated bots or scripts to manipulate interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To access certain features, you may be required to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and all activities under your account. When signing up, you must enter your real age, and by doing so, you confirm that the age you provide is accurate and reflects your actual age.</p>
        <p>MicDown complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which restricts the collection of personal information from users under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may only create an account with parental consent and supervision. A parent or legal guardian must create a linked parent account and be responsible for managing and monitoring the child’s activity. If we discover that an account was created in violation of COPPA without proper parental consent, it will be terminated immediately.</p>
        <p>To verify that an account belongs to an adult, users creating an account as a parent or guardian must provide both a valid government-issued ID and a verified phone number for age verification. This information will be securely processed and not stored beyond the verification process.</p>

        <h2>4. Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your use of MicDown is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data.</p>

        <p>By posting on MicDown, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute your content within the platform.</p>

        <h2>6. Termination & Suspension</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you violate these terms or engage in any harmful behavior.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>MicDown is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.</p>
        <p>We are not liable for any damages arising from the use of our platform.</p>
